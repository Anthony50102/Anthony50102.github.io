# Anthony Poole

Hi! I’m Anthony. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin and currently work at Microsoft, where I develop an internal tool that uses LLMs to help security engineers identify insecure code across Microsoft’s codebase.

I’m also active in academic research, focusing on probabilistic reduced-order models with the [Willcox Lab](https://kiwi.oden.utexas.edu) and on deep-learning, physics-based models for ergodic and chaotic systems—especially with applications in turbulence—alongside my collaborator [Ionut Farcas](https://math.vt.edu/people/faculty/farcas-ionut-gabriel.html).
